# TimePatrol
A java based Sci-Fi side-scrolling platformer with a variable world physics and a procedurally generated world, designed in processing.

Compile Instructions:

- Put the file in a folder called "TimePatrol"
- Open the "TimePatrol.pde" file using processing
- Execute the program to start the game.

Player: You are a part of an organization that fixes anomalies in time.

Premise: You are travelling in time to kill off people causing anomalies in time
and our job is to traverse through various time-lines killing off the anomalies
and the minions (boss for each level) of the final boss of each level to get the
next time to go to. We go through 30 time-lines and then we face the final boss
and kill him, avoid a time paradox.

Progression: As you go through the levels, or die enough, you will start to
realize that the randomness is going up. Time travel is taking its toll and the
vessel youâ€™re travelling in is experiencing physics differently than the rest of
the world. Get used to the new physics of each travel and use it to your
advantage and free the timelines.

Controls: Arrow keys or W,A,D can be used to move around and jump, and the mouse
can be used to aim and click to shoot.
